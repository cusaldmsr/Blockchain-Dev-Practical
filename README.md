# Blockchain-Dev-Practical

This repository is intended for hands-on practical work in blockchain development, primarily using Solidity.

## Overview

The `Blockchain-Dev-Practical` repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with smart contract development, testing, and deployment. It is ideal for those learning blockchain concepts or building practical skills with decentralized applications.

## Features

- Focuses on Solidity smart contract development.
- Provides a structure for practical exercises and experimentation.
- Intended for blockchain developers and learners.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cusaldmsr/Blockchain-Dev-Practical.git
   cd Blockchain-Dev-Practical
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
   - (Optional) Install [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) for Solidity development.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile Contracts**
   - Use your preferred framework to compile Solidity contracts.

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   - Execute tests to validate your contracts.

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

## Usage

- Explore the Solidity files to understand different smart contract patterns and experiments.
- Modify and extend the contracts as needed for your practical work.
- Use standard tools like Hardhat or Truffle to deploy and interact with contracts.
